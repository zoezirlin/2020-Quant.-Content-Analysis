This is the accompanying code for a quantitative content analysis of 50 pre-WWII Nazi propaganda posters. A coding survey was completed for each poster in qualtrics, and the data was then exported and imported in SAS. A long series of IF -> THEN statements were used to identify present traits and assign the corresponding poster to a category, (IE- trope 1, 2, etc.)

For example, if a girl with blonde hair was marked as "PRESENT" in a coding survey, then the algorithm would read this and assign the poster in which the girl was identified as showing trope X, (trope X being whichever trope, or category, includes the depiction of girls with blonde hair.)

The coding survey includes trait identification of every visual aspect of the posters, populating data collection of visual imagery through a quantitative lense. The sampling population, about 400 propaganda posters, comes from the archives of the United States Holocaust Museum and Archives. A coding survey was then created, which details the ways in which the data is gathered. Two undergraduate students at Florida State University were incentivized to be “content-coders”, and each analyzed a segment of the sample propaganda posters, guided by the codebook, to ensure that the research can be duplicated.
