The coding survey includes trait identification of every visual aspect of the posters, populating data collection of visual imagery through a quantitative lense. The sampling population, about 400 propaganda posters, comes from the archives of the United States Holocaust Museum and Archives. A coding survey was then created, which details the ways in which the data is gathered. Two undergraduate students at Florida State University were incentivized to be “content-coders”, and each analyzed a segment of the sample propaganda posters, guided by the codebook, to ensure that the research can be duplicated.
